\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this report is to discuss our findings and results of our formal verification project for ECE 5745. Our original proposal was centered around verifying a 3-bit Elliptical Curve Arithmetic Unit (ECAU) circuit as a proof of concept. After some studying, our project led us to investigate the 3-bit greatest common divisor (GCD) circuit which would be required in a 3-bit ECAU. Our main point of investigation was to determine if verification of a 3-bit GCD circuit is trivial or nontrivial. Once this question could be answered, we could later explore if the verification could be easily transposed onto an $n$-bit GCD circuit.

This report will detail our findings as well as identified areas of further interest and exploration.

\section{Experiments and Test Setup}

Our first starting point was designing a circuit that computed a 3-bit GCD. This circuit can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:gcd}. Once this circuit was created, it took some refining to ensure that it would act as expected. A GCD circuit, as implemented here, would require at most $n$ clock cycles for an $n$-bit circuit. Once the circuit was created, we were then able to create polynomials for the nets in the circuits.

We first implemented the comparator circuit. The ring consisted of the primary inputs, the fan out branches, and the primary outputs. Once all of the polynomials were instantiated, an ideal J miter was used with each polynomial as well as the vanishing polynomials of the circuit. This aspect of the project is most likely trivial but worth while to ensure that our final implementation was correct. 

The GCD testing was conducted in similar fashion with the inputs, outputs, and nets of the circuit being instantiated into polynomials. There was a great deal of polynomials required for such a circuit. This process will need to be automated when dealing with circuits larger than 3 bits.
